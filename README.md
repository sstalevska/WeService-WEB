# WeService-WEB
Web platform containing businesses in many categories and their reviews left by clients. Site visitors can search by name of business, category of business or a certain needed service. This platform will be an intermediary between clients and the database of businesses and will serve to clients who want to know more about a certain business, without commiting to visit it with no previous information, to avoid client dissatisfaction.

This application is developed using PHP and Postgres Database server. The web application can be run on Laragon, which contains PHP, Postgres and nginx as a server.
